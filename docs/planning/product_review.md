# AstroTracker - Product Review Document

**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

## 1. Executive Summary

This document reviews the planned features and proposed technology stack for the AstroTracker project. AstroTracker aims to be a visually appealing, dynamic, fast, and secure web-based astrology platform providing users with interactive tools like natal chart generation, transit tracking, compatibility analysis, and personalized horoscopes. The technical approach focuses on leveraging modern web technologies to deliver a high-quality user experience, particularly for complex chart visualizations and data interactions, while ensuring security and maintainability.

## 2. Core Features Summary

Based on `docs/planning/initial_features.md`, the core functionality will include:

*   **Astrological Calculations:**
    *   Natal Chart Generation (multiple house systems, aspects, AI interpretations).
    *   Transit & Progression Tracking (real-time overlays, timeline view, dynamic updates).
    *   Synastry & Compatibility Analysis (bi-wheels, composite charts, aspect analysis).
*   **User Content:**
    *   Personalized Horoscopes (daily/weekly/monthly based on natal chart).
    *   Astrology Learning Hub (interactive glossary, tutorials, contextual info).
*   **User Accounts & Interaction:**
    *   Secure User Accounts with Google OAuth integration.
    *   Profile Management (multiple chart storage).
    *   Personal Notes & Customization.
    *   Sharing & Export capabilities (links, images, PDFs).

## 3. User Experience Goals

The application prioritizes a superior user experience characterized by:

*   **Visual Appeal:** Modern, potentially themeable (dark/light) UI, inspired by reference designs, with high-quality chart rendering.
*   **Interactivity:** Smooth, dynamic updates without page reloads, interactive charts (zoom/pan), and responsive controls.
*   **Performance:** Fast load times, smooth animations, and efficient data handling, even with complex calculations and dense UI elements.
*   **Accessibility:** Adherence to WCAG guidelines.
*   **Responsiveness:** Seamless functionality across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## 4. Technology Stack Overview

The proposed stack (detailed in `docs/planning/technology_stack.md`) is designed to meet the UX and functional goals:

*   **Frontend:** Astro (for overall structure & performance) with React (for interactive UI islands/components) and Tailwind CSS (for styling).
*   **Charting/Visualization:** Direct SVG/Canvas rendering (via React) for core chart wheels, potentially supported by D3.js for complex calculations. Libraries like Recharts/Nivo for standard graphs and Leaflet for maps.
*   **Backend:** Python with FastAPI (for high-performance API).
*   **Astrology Engine:** Python library (e.g., Kerykeion, PyEphem) for calculations.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (managed via SQLModel/SQLAlchemy).
*   **Authentication:** FastAPI Users with Google OAuth support.
*   **State Management:** Zustand (for React components).
*   **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), Render/Fly.io (Backend via Docker).
*   **Package Management:** PNPM (Frontend), Poetry (Backend).

## 5. Key Technical Decisions & Rationale

*   **Astro + React:** Combines Astro's static-first performance benefits with React's ecosystem for building the necessary complex, interactive UI components (charts, forms, data grids).
*   **FastAPI:** Chosen for its high performance, asynchronous capabilities, excellent developer experience, and automatic API documentation, suitable for powering a dynamic frontend.
*   **Python Backend:** Leverages mature and accurate Python libraries available for astrological calculations.
*   **PostgreSQL:** A robust and scalable relational database suitable for storing user data and saved chart configurations.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Enables rapid development of a custom, utility-first UI matching the desired visual density and aesthetic.
*   **Specific Charting Approach:** Using direct SVG/Canvas for core wheels allows maximum customization, while standard libraries handle simpler graphs efficiently.
*   **FastAPI Users:** Provides a secure and feature-complete solution for authentication, including the required Google OAuth integration.

## 6. Security & Privacy Approach

Security is a core consideration:

*   **Authentication:** Secure user registration/login via FastAPI Users, leveraging Google OAuth.
*   **Data Encryption:** Sensitive birth data will be encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (database encryption).
*   **Secure Practices:** Adherence to secure development practices to mitigate common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.).
*   **Privacy Controls:** Users will have control over data sharing and visibility.

## 7. Performance Considerations

Performance is critical for the desired user experience:

*   **Frontend:** Astro minimizes JavaScript by default; React islands load interactively. Optimized code, efficient data loading, and smooth animations are targeted.
*   **Backend:** FastAPI's async nature and Python's libraries support efficient calculations.
*   **Caching:** Strategies (CDN, server-side, client-side) will be employed.
*   **Charting:** Performance of complex SVG/Canvas rendering needs careful optimization (see Risks).

## 8. Potential Risks & Considerations

Key challenges identified during planning include:

*   **UI Density:** Ensuring the UI remains performant and usable despite the high density of information and controls shown in reference designs.
*   **Chart Performance:** Rendering complex, interactive astrological charts (especially wheels with many elements) in the browser can be CPU/GPU intensive and requires significant optimization efforts.
*   **Data Fetching:** Designing efficient communication and data flow between the backend API and potentially numerous interactive frontend components is crucial for responsiveness.
*   **Astrology Engine Accuracy & Performance:** Selecting/integrating an astrology calculation engine that is both accurate and performant enough for real-time interaction.

## 9. Conclusion

The proposed features and technology stack for AstroTracker provide a solid foundation for building a comprehensive, performant, and visually engaging astrology platform. The combination of Astro, React, FastAPI, and specialized visualization techniques appears well-suited to the project's goals. Key areas requiring careful attention during development include optimizing chart rendering performance and managing the complexity of the data-dense user interface.
